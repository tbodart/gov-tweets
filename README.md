# gov-tweets

This is my final project for one of my classes in my Data Science master's program. The purpose of the project is to explore Twitter data using Twitter's API Tweepy.  

For my research question, I asked what amount of COVID-19 information is each US governor sharing via Twitter. I then used tweepy to collect up to 100 tweets from each state governor's official Twitter account from the past 7 days. I loaded information on these tweets into a pandas dataframe and analyzed certain metrics, such as proportion of tweets containing mention of the pandemic, and saved that data in a new dataframe, one row per governor. I then visualized this data and attempted to draw some conclusions, and ask further questions. A full run-through of my project can be viewed in the `results-notebook.ipynb`.
